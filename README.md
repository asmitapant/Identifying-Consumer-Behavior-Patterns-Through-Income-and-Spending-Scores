# Identifying-Consumer-Behavior-Patterns-Through-Income-and-Spending-Scores
This R project applies K-Means clustering to a real-life inspired dataset of customer income and spending scores. The goal is to segment customers into distinct behavioral groups based on their financial habits.
Key steps include:

Creating a two-dimensional dataset (Income vs. Spending)

Applying the kmeans() function with three clusters

Assigning cluster labels to each observation

Visualizing clusters along with their centroids

The output includes both a summary of clustering performance and a color-coded scatterplot that reveals spending patterns across income groupsâ€”ideal for marketing or customer profiling tasks.
